# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📋 Problem Statement
Analyze the Titanic passenger dataset to understand survival patterns and identify key factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore passenger demographics and characteristics
- Analyze survival rates across different passenger groups
- Identify key factors affecting survival probability
- Generate actionable insights from the data

## 🔍 Approach
1. **Data Loading**: Import Titanic dataset using scikit-learn
2. **Data Exploration**: Examine structure, missing values, and basic statistics
3. **Survival Analysis**: Analyze survival patterns by various factors
4. **Visualization**: Create comprehensive charts and graphs
5. **Insights Generation**: Extract key findings and patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
python titanic_eda.py
```

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Overall Survival Rate**: ~38% of passengers survived
- **Gender Impact**: Women had significantly higher survival rates
- **Class Effect**: First-class passengers had better survival chances
- **Age Factor**: Children had higher survival rates than adults

## 📈 Visualizations Generated
- Survival count distribution
- Survival rates by passenger class
- Survival rates by gender
- Age and fare distributions
- Survival patterns by age groups

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Dataset loading
