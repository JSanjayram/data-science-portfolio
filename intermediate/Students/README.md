# 📊 Student Performance Correlation Analysis

## 📋 Problem Statement
Analyze correlations between various factors affecting student performance using comprehensive heatmaps to identify key relationships between academic scores, lifestyle factors, and performance metrics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create correlation heatmaps for student performance data
- Identify key factors influencing academic success
- Analyze relationships between different subjects
- Visualize lifestyle impact on performance
- Generate actionable insights for education improvement

## 🔍 Approach
1. **Data Generation**: Create realistic student dataset with correlated variables
2. **Multiple Heatmaps**: 6 different correlation visualizations
3. **Factor Analysis**: Identify strongest performance predictors
4. **Subject Relationships**: Inter-subject correlation analysis
5. **Lifestyle Impact**: Study habits and performance correlation

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run correlation analysis
python student_correlation.py
```
